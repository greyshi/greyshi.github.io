title: Why I Switched to Jekyll

I tweaked and refined my [first website][old] over the course of a few months to get it just right, but last night after discovering [Jekyll] [jekyll], I decided to throw it all away and replace it with something new.

Jekyll sites can be hosted on Github for **free** with **no usage limits**. Can't say the same for my old Heroku setup. I still love Heroku, and it definitely has its place, but traffic spikes will kill you if you're on the free tier. Also, deploying with Jekyll is even simpler than it is with Heroku. I didn't know that was possible, but you can't really beat "what lives in your GitHub repo is on the site."

I don't have all the functionality I had on my old site on this one, but I love the minimalism I get in exchange. It's the main reason I made the switch. I've really liked blogging on [Medium][medium] for my Software Engineering class so far. It's almost zen-like, being the website equivilent of an all-white room. After finding this simple layout for Jekyll and changing the font to something that's both unorthodox and awesome, there was no question about dropping my old site.

While Medium's post editor is beautiful, the editor for Jekyll is whatever you want it to be. Posts are just markdown text files, and Jekyll converts them to static web pages under the hood. My setup is [Sublime][sublime]. The full screen distraction free mode is great for writing, and being able to use vim commands makes it better for me than any online editor. Here's how it looks.

I'll end this by addressing my old site. Have a happy retirement. I learned Django, Bootstrap, and a bit of Web design from you. We spent a bit of the summer together, and I probably won't forget you any time soon.
