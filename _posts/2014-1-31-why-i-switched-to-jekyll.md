title: Why I Switched to Jekyll

I tweaked and refined my [first website][old] for months to get it just right, but last night, after discovering
[Jekyll] [jekyll], I decided to throw it all away and replace it with something new and shiny.

Jekyll sites can be hosted on Github for **free** with **no usage limits**. Can't say the same for my old
Heroku setup. I still love Heroku, but traffic spikes will kill you if you're on the free tier. Also, deploying
is **even simpler** than before. I didn't know that was possible, but you can't really beat "what lives in your GitHub repo is on the site."

I don't have all the functionality I had on my old site on this one, but I love the **minimalism** I get in exchange.
In fact, the minimalism is the main reason I made the switch. I've really liked blogging on [Medium][medium] for
my Software Engineering class so far. It's been zen. After finding this simple layout for Jekyll and changing the
font to something that's both unorthodox and awesome, it was over. Guess I can't resist simple design.

While Medium's blog post editor is as zen as the posts themselves, the editor for Jekyll is whatever you want it
to be. Posts are just markdown text files, and Jekyll converts them to static web pages under the hood. My setup
is [sublime][sublime]. Here's how it looks.

I'll end this by addressing my old site. Have a long and happy retirement. I learned Django and Bootstrap and a
bit of Web design from you. We spent the end of the summer together, and you will always be in my heart.
