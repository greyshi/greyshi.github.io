A couple days ago I was introduced to virtual reality first-hand during a class lab session. Coincidentally, on the same day I witnessed the buzz generated around virtual reality thanks to Facebook's acquisition of Oculus Rift, the front-runner in the field. Some people think of this acquisition as a blow to the emergence of the technology, complaining that it'll have ads and force you to integrate with the social media platform, but after experiencing the digital world, I'm convinced that nothing will stop virtual reality from blowing up (in a good way). I can't wait to get my hands (or face?) what Facebook or a competitor finally releases after pouring loads of cash and talent at the problem.

I wasn't at all expecting to be blown away during my lab session for my Computational Brain class. I arrived ten minutes late to the scene of a girl wearing a spandex bodysuit with red LED's all over it and the large helmet she had on. Next to her was my TA for the class, who was standing in front of a computer with three monitors. Two of them were right next to each other and displayed the view of a room that changed fluidly respective to the movements of the girl in the suit. I was looking at her visual field in the virtual world that consisted of a dojo reminiscent of the one in which Morpheus fights Neo in The Matrix. I was more than happy to find that I'd get to try on the suit as well. Especially cause I'm a big Matrix fan.

Systems like the Oculus Rift focus only on the visual portion of virtual reality, but this one integrated motion and vision to closely resemble the experience only found in the flesh. The motion tracking system was simpler than I had imagined. The person in the LED covered suit stood in a rectangular perimeter of about 500 square feet, which was surrounded by cameras. These cameras were used to track the LEDs to model body movement. This allowed for the translation of body and head movement to a respective visual field displayed in the helmet. In effect, I could walk, run, jump, or twirl my head in circles, and it looked as if I was doing it in the dojo rather than in the basement lab. This means that even a preliminary system is capable of placing you in any reality imaginable, and somewhat convincingly at that.

The novelty of walking around in that three-dimensional space was greater than I've experienced in a long time. I think this novelty will draw the massive attention needed to introduce the technology, and the value of existing in and interacting with an infinite number of possible realities will keep it from being forgotten.

I won't get far into the specifics of our experiment, but it involved using our finger to follow a sphere that traveled along varying three-dimensional paths that appeared in front of us. That took the experience a step further than simply existing in a digital place by letting us interact with the environment and watch it change before our eyes. Standing in the center of a path and turning my body to follow a digital ball was surreal.

Before experiencing it for myself, I thought of virtual reality as something that would exist in the distant future. Now I'm more optimistic.

Early investors in Oculus' Kickstarter campaign are upset, but the truth of the matter is that Facebook's money and resources will help the technology by raising the bar, forcing competition to keep up. Virtual reality is awesome, and the technology to make it happen already exists. It's only a matter of time until we put it all together. I'm looking forward to experiencing a full version of the Matrix in my lifetime. Maybe I'll come back and read this post from a virtual world for a kick of nostalgia.
