I took a class last semester called Software Engineering, and the professor was [a most peculiar man][simongar]. He was unorthodox compared to other professors in more than a few ways, and one of them was that he offered extra credit to those in the class who would keep a weekly blog that was relevant to the class. I think he started doing this because he read a pretty good blog post by Joel Spolsky called [Advice for Computer Science College Students][joelonsoftware], cause he assigned it as one of our first class readings. Funnily enough I'd already read it a couple semesters before on the recommendation of a different professor. As a matter of fact, it was one of the things that convinced me to try to become a better writer by publishing generally uninteresting content such as this on the Internet.

On to the point, me being the kind of person at the time who liked extra credit and writing practice made the decision to write that blog easy. It did get tedious, and I'll admit I half-assed a few out of the fourteen blog posts, but it's fourteen pages of writing that I'd rather not see get buried into oblivion. So out of obligation, even if I'm only speaking to my future self who will probably read this at some point, [here they are][medium].
