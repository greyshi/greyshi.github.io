A little while ago I wanted to become a better writer pretty badly. I'd still like to, but the goal is no longer fresh and on my mind. I've put it off. It's why this is the first thing I've written in six months. 

Anyways, I took a class last semester called Software Engineering, and the professor was [a most peculiar man][simongar]. He was unorthodox compared to other professors in more than a few ways, and one of them was that he offered extra credit to those in the class who would keep a weekly blog that was relevant to the class. I think he started doing this because he read a pretty good blog post by Joel Spolsky called [Advice for Computer Science College Students][joelonsoftware]. He assigned it as one of our first class readings, but I'd already read it some time before that. Matter of fact, it was one of the things that convinced me to try to become a better writer. 

Well, me being the kind of person at the time who liked extra credit and writing practice made the decision to write that blog easy. It did get tedious, and I'll admit I half-assed a few out of the fourteen blog posts, but it's fourteen pages of writing that I'd rather not see get buried into the oblivion of the Internet. So, out of obligation, even if I'm only speaking to my future self who will probably read this at some point, [here they are][medium].
