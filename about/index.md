I'm a software developer mainly interested in designing and building web applications.
Currently enjoying my last few months as a college student at [UT Austin][ut].

Once I graduate I'll get to do whatever I want for a few months before moving to Seattle to
start working at Amazon. I'll be a developer on their new initiatives team.

I love music. On the blog you'll find that I've ended each of my posts with a link to a special song
I've chosen at the time of writing.
