    <p>All through my education I&#39;ve dreaded keeping up with assignment due dates and when my next exam is. It always felt as if I was forgetting something and that I&#39;d suffer if I did. This hardly ever actually happened, but I was tired of keeping up with these things and decided I wanted technology to remember for me.</p>

<p>Allow me to reintroduce you to your calendar app. I use google calendar integrated with my OSX calendar app, but either by itself will work fine. You might be thinking, &quot;I already use calendars, and I&#39;m not about to schedule tasks I want to accomplish on there because they don&#39;t happen at a set time and I don&#39;t want to pollute my pure, beautiful calendar.&quot; Well, I can&#39;t really blame you because I felt the same way at one point in my life. The trick, however, is to create an all-day event for each task!</p>

<p>All-day events show up at the top of the calendar. Here&#39;s a part of my week:</p>

<p>As you can see, I&#39;ve got a view of everything I need to keep track of in one place. If you want to be reminded of an upcoming task, setting that up is as easy as editing the event and adding an alert. No need to go through the reminders app.</p>

<p>Another beautiful things is that I can see what&#39;s on my plate anywhere I am as long as I&#39;ve got my phone with me. Here&#39;s what tomorrow looks like:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a few things due tomorrow, and two of them are writing assignments. I guess writing that essay thirty minutes ago got me in the mood to make this blog post.</p>

<p>Now, my people, go forth and schedule every task can get your hands on!</p>
